# Purpose
 - the goal of this concept project was to create a program that show's biases and where mental models can be used using Gemini. 
---
# How Its Done
 - Using streamlit for the UI, and python as the backend, you can create this program pretty easily with just an API key
 - You must use the streamlit secrets feature in the cloud if you wan't it to work.
---
# Possible Additions
 - This is the backbones of a simple 'enter text - gemini outputs' system.
     - This could be edited to fit many needs, this is just the one I chose.
